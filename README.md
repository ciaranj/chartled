## Synopsis

Pure node.js graphite-a-like, provides charting support over a whsiper file backend.

You probably shouldn't be using this project, it *will* change abruptly and without warning and most certainly isn't ready for consumption :)

## Motivation

Graphite is *awesome*, no really, you should go install it right now: http://graphite.wikidot.com/installation it is far better than this project will ever be (probably).

However it is also fairly tricky to install and get running, unless you're a python wizard. I wanted to provide as compatible an API as I could but in a pure node.js form that would be trivial to install on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.

This project aims to solve the same problem as Graphite in as compatible a way as possible, but will also add extra features that I want ;) 

## Installation

To install:
  git clone https://github.com/ciaranj/chartled.git

  cd chartled

  npm install

## Tests

To run the tests 'npm test' after performing the installation steps above.
