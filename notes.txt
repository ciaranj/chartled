A chart, should consist of multiple layers, and multiple axes.

There is at least 1 vertical axis, but there can be many. Each axis has an associated scale
however only 2 vertical axes can be visible at a given time, one on the left and one on the right.

A metric source is associated with a single axis and with a single layer.
A Layer can have metric sources on it that are associated to different axes.
Multiple metric sources can be associated with the same axis and same layers.
Layers can be stacked, or grouped, streamed or spanned..depending on the type  of layer (bar or line ?)
