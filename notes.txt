A chart, should consist of multiple layers, and multiple axes.

There is at least 1 vertical axis, but there can be many. Each axis has an associated scale
however only 2 vertical axes can be visible at a given time, one on the left and one on the right.

A metric source is associated with a single axis and with a single layer.

A Layer can contain multiple metric sources.
An axis can be associated with multiple metric sources

Layers can be stacked, or grouped, streamed or spanned..depending on the type  of layer (bar or line ?) 

So given the data, we need to to group by layer to calculate any layout specifics, such as stacking.  
Apply scale by axis (after stacking etc.), then render in layout order.
