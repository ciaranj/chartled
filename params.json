{"name":"Chartled","tagline":"pure node.js graphite-a-like","body":"### Synopsis\r\nPure node.js graphite-a-like, provides charting support over a whsiper file backend.\r\n\r\nYou probably shouldn't be using this project, it *will* change abruptly and without warning and most certainly isn't ready for consumption :)\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nGraphite is *awesome*, no really, you should go install it right now: http://graphite.wikidot.com/installation it is far better than this project will ever be (probably).\r\n\r\nHowever it is also fairly tricky to install and get running, unless you're a python wizard. I wanted to provide as compatible an API as I could but in a pure node.js form that would be trivial to install on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to solve the same problem as Graphite in as compatible a way as possible, but will also add extra features that I want ;) \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ciaranj/chartled.git\r\n$ cd chartled\r\n$npm install -d\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nTo run the tests 'npm test' after performing the installation steps above.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nJust me so far :)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nMIT Licensed","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
